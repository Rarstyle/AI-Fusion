# AI Fusion Setup Guide üì∏

## Camera Setup for Best Results

### 1. Distance & Positioning
- **6-8 feet away** from your exercise area
- Mount at **hip height** for most exercises
- Ensure your **entire body is visible** in frame
- Leave some space above your head and below your feet

### 2. Lighting
- **Face the light source** (window or lights)
- Avoid backlighting (camera shouldn't face windows)
- Even lighting reduces tracking errors
- Outdoor or bright indoor lighting works best

### 3. Background
- **Clear, uncluttered** background
- Solid colors work better than patterns
- Avoid mirrors (can confuse the AI)
- Remove objects that might be mistaken for body parts

### 4. Camera Angles by Exercise

#### Squat
- **Side view** (90¬∞ to your body)
- Hip height placement
- Full side profile visible

#### Deadlift
- **Side view** (90¬∞ to your body)
- Hip height placement
- Capture from head to floor

#### Push-Up
- **Side view** (90¬∞ to your body)
- Ground level or slightly elevated
- Entire body from head to toes

#### Row
- **Front view** (facing you)
- Chest/shoulder height
- Both shoulders visible

#### Overhead Press
- **Front view** (facing you)
- Chest height
- Capture from floor to extended arms overhead

## Troubleshooting

### "No Pose Detected"
- Move closer to the camera (but keep full body visible)
- Improve lighting
- Wear contrasting clothing
- Clear the background

### Inconsistent Tracking
- Reduce motion blur (better lighting)
- Avoid baggy clothing
- Ensure stable camera placement
- Check internet connection isn't affecting device performance

### Poor Rep Counting
- Verify correct camera angle for exercise
- Complete full range of motion
- Move at controlled pace (not too fast)
- Ensure landmarks are visible throughout movement

## Device Requirements

### Minimum Specs
- Modern smartphone or tablet (2020+)
- Camera: 720p or better
- Browser: Chrome, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- RAM: 4GB+ recommended

### Optimal Specs
- iPhone 12+ or equivalent Android
- Camera: 1080p
- Good lighting conditions
- Stable internet for initial model download

## Tips for Success

1. **Warm up first** - Start with a few reps without the AI
2. **Start with basics** - Master form before adding weight
3. **Use corrective plans** - Address issues before next session
4. **Practice camera setup** - Find your best angle
5. **Review feedback** - Learn from your patterns
6. **Be patient** - Form improvement takes time

## Exercise-Specific Tips

### Squats
- Stand perpendicular to camera
- Ensure knees are visible throughout
- Full depth matters for detection

### Deadlifts
- Keep bar/weight visible if possible
- Hip hinge is key tracking point
- Side view captures back position best

### Push-Ups
- Keep body straight (plank position)
- Side view shows elbow angle clearly
- Ground should be visible

### Rows
- Face camera directly
- Both elbows should track
- Stable torso helps detection

### Overhead Press
- Face camera squarely
- Full lockout overhead is critical
- Keep feet planted
